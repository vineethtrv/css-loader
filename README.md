# CSS Loaders & Spinners
A general situation that we all might face while going through websites/apps is to wait for some progress or something to get loaded. A most simple solution in such scenarios is to use a loader or spinner to indicate users that something is loading in the background.
Considering this, I tried to create a library having a collection of such loaders/spinners. There are no image dependencies for this library. It's developed using pure CSS. Hence it will load fast and is easily customizable too.

## HTML

Each loader has been build on top of a single html tag, so that it is easily portable. Hence more convenient to be intrgrate with projects 

```html

<div class="loader"></div>

```
